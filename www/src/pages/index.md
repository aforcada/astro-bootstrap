- title: Hand crafted for Astro.js
  text: To maintain astro's fast build times we have created native Astro components. To minimise JS sent to the browser, our components use stock bootstrap JS modules. No need to hydrate your components with React.
- title: Bootstrap CSS at its core
  text: All our components are compadible with Bootstrap 5. By relying entirely on the Bootstrap stylesheet you can customise the components with Bootstrap's powerfull SCSS variables. You can also drop the components into existing themes.
- title: Built for rapid development
  text: We understand that unnecessary components will slow down development for someone who is experienced with bootstrap 5. Since astro gives you such easy control over HTML we have only created Astro components in cases where they will make your code more dry. Stock bootstrap JS has been included in these modules.
